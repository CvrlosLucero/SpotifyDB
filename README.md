# Query and Uploader for Spotify Database

This repository contains tools and scripts for managing and analyzing a Spotify database. Below is a detailed description of the included files and folders:

## Files and Folders

### Folders

1. **`DB/`**
   - Contains scripts related to the database, such as table schemas, initial data, or specific SQL queries.

2. **`__pycache__/`**
   - Automatically generated by Python, this folder contains compiled `.pyc` files to speed up script execution.

### Files

1. **`.gitattributes`**
   - Git configuration file. Defines how certain file types are handled, such as differences between binary and text files, or line-ending conversions.

2. **`Graphics.ipynb`**
   - A Jupyter notebook for data analysis and visualization. Includes graphs, statistics, and visual representations based on database information.

3. **`connection.py`**
   - Python script for managing the database connection. Provides functions for authentication, executing queries, and interacting with the SQL server.

4. **`dash.py`**
   - Python script that uses the Dash library to create interactive web interfaces. Enables dynamic visualization of data or query results from the database.

5. **`ddl`**
   - File related to **Data Definition Language** (DDL). Includes SQL commands to define the database structure, such as creating tables, indexes, or views.

6. **`massive_data_upload.sql`**
   - SQL script for performing bulk data uploads into the database. Useful for inserting large volumes of records from external files or datasets.

## Usage

1. **Data Analysis**: Use `Graphics.ipynb` to explore and visualize data.
2. **Database Management**: Scripts in `DB/` and the `ddl` file allow you to configure and maintain the database structure.
3. **Data Upload**: Execute `massive_data_upload.sql` to import large amounts of data into the database.
4. **Connection and Queries**: Use `connection.py` and `dash.py` to interact with the database and build custom web interfaces.
